# Java-Auto-Corrector-
This program is intended to be superior to pythons built in auto-correcting libraries.

NOTE:
1. Make sure that the music files and the word file is in the same directory as the program.java
2. To add more words you can add it them into the word bank through the UI or through the word file (it will sort it automatically)
3. This program is intended to autocorrect basic sentences but has the ability to be easily expanded and improved upon by adding more english specific rules or neural networks to determine the tone of a paragraph etc.
